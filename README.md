**Don't copy my skins, please. Grow some balls and enhance your own creativity.**

**If I'm doing something wrong out in public, honest to God tell me. I heavily loathe free-hiders.**

**Quick About Me:**

My name's Kitt(spi)/Korryn/Kloudy

♀️(She/Her) They/Them. He/Him is fine. Cis-Girl.

**One thing you should especially know is that I keep a consistent personality. My actions and/or responses are usually in hand with whom I'm talking to. In other words,

I try to match one another's personality so I  can attempt to have them feel comfortable with me. This applies to vibe of places and friend groups. 

I am very self-insecure at the moment, so I apologize in advance.

🌈 -- My skin/morph style(s) usually has a rainbow theme to it, unless the colors are difficult to blend otherwise. If you see someone that appears to be "Skittle-fied", you may have spot the one and only Kittspi (me 😊).


❌ -- I dislike copying/taking hard inspo. Vice versa as well. If I end up having a similar morph/skin to any of yours, varying on mood, then I could change its design; just ask me. **If you do not see the following social tags: (PATREON- ☁️ Kloudy Kittspi..); (GITHUB- @KLOUDATIONS); then it's not me. Just to get that established.**


 🗨️ -- My Discord's just "kittspi". Tell me your user so I can verify.
